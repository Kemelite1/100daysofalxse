# Day 1 - Revisiting Arrays in javascript
Today marks the beginning of my #100DaysOfCode challenge, and I decided to kick it off by revisiting one of the fundamental data structures in JavaScript: `Array` as a data structure is like a big container into which we can throw variables inside and reference later. Arrays can hold any number of values we want and they are also zero-based, meaning the first element is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.
## Array Methods
1. **Push():** This method adds elements to the end of the array
2. **Pop():** Removes the last element of the array and we don't have to pass any argument
3. **Unshift():** Adds element to the beginning of the array
4. **Shift():** Removes element from the beginning.
5. **Slice():** Used to extract parts of an array without changing the original array
6. **Splice():** Works like the slice method but changes the original array. The extracted elements are taken out of the array
7. **indexOf():** Tells us in which position a certain element is in the array. Returns -1 for element not in the array.
8. **include():** returns true if the element is in the array.
9. **forEach():** Used for looping through an array
